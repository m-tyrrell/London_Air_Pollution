The analysis consists of a short script written in Python. This script processess the dataset selecting priority variables and creating index variables based on the L2 distance between NOx and deprivation variables. The script also outputs a visualisation of the correlation matrix. The data were then visualised and further analysed using Tableau.

To repeat the analysis, open process.py, check packages, enter relevant directory path data, and run script

The Tableau workbook is provided in the "Guy and St Thomas.twbx" file. In addition, a version of the workbook is available temporarily online at the Tableau public gallery at the following link:
